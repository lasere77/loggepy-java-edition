# Loggepy edition java

password generator and manager

---
## loggepy information
Loggepy java edition is a computer password generator and manager. it will allow you to secure your password and numbers and by storing them only on your own machine, loggepy has a simple and easy-to-use interface and will generate uncrackable passwords for you, 
example: example=P5&#W1XQe-8q90A2H'c>9O'-&sZ
but as this password will be very long to copy loggepy to a scene to directly copy the password to the clipboard you will just have to put the name of the password you want to copy and that's it

## compile
**the jar was compiled into an exe using:** 
üëâ [**launch4j**](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/)
in the configuration of the exe there is the location of java(18.0.2 jdk)
the jvm arguments for javafx which are: --module-path "C:\loggepy-edition-java\javafx-sdk-18.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

**and the installer was made with inno setup**
üëâ [**inno setup**](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
the installer will install the files for the passwords plus the backup file and the log file.
And for the proper functioning of the java program (18.0.2 jdk) plus javafx sdk and to finish a batch file I made for the version change.
All it's stoker sound file in the same place in "C:\Program Files (x86)\loggepy-edition-java".

## update
in the future update (1.1.1) the file encryption system containing the passwords will be implemented, so you will have to enter your password to be able to access loggepy.

## launch
to launch loggepy you just need to install the installer:
‚ö†Ô∏èattention it will be necessary to install the setup loggepy-edition-java and not the executable loggepy this one is the resource for the system of updates‚ö†Ô∏è
[**Releases**](https://github.com/lasere77/loggepy-java-edition/releases)
you just need to run it. It is possible that it is detected as a virus on your computer because it has no signature which is not serious,then you proceed with the installation and once the installation is finished make sure you have launched it loggepy as administrator otherwise the application will not launch.
